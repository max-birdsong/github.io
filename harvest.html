              <h2>Background</h2>

              <p>
                Fisheries managers face a core challenge: <strong>angler behavior drives mortality as much as regulations do</strong>.  
                Even when legal harvest rules are clear, outcomes depend on whether anglers choose to keep or release fish.  
                In Germany, where cultural norms lean strongly toward consumption, this makes voluntary catch-and-release a pivotal yet 
                unpredictable factor. Our project tackles this problem by <strong>analyzing large-scale trip records and angler data</strong> 
                to uncover what shapes harvest decisions—providing management with evidence-based levers to align conservation targets 
                with actual on-the-water behavior.
              </p>

          <h2>Executive Summary</h2>

          <p>
          Voluntary catch-and-release (vCandR) is increasingly shaping the future of German fisheries. 
          Drawing on nearly <strong>20,000 trip-level records</strong> from anglers in two northern states 
          (<strong>Lower Saxony in the West, Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania in the East</strong>), 
          our study offers one of the most comprehensive looks at how <strong>culture, angler traits, and context</strong> 
          interact to drive harvest decisions. 
          We find clear contrasts between regions: East German anglers harvest a larger share of their catch, 
          while West German anglers demonstrate higher release rates—reflecting legacies of culture, governance, and norms. 
          </p>

          <p>
          Beyond geography, <strong>species, fish size, and angler characteristics</strong> strongly influence behavior. 
          Marine and migratory species are kept more often than freshwater fish, 
          while trout and cod show consistently high harvest rates. 
          Age, lifestyle centrality, and consumptive orientation push anglers toward keeping fish, 
          whereas higher skill and stronger commitment reduce harvest likelihood. 
          Fish size plays a pivotal role: intermediate-sized fish are most likely to be harvested, 
          while both small and trophy-sized fish are more often released. 
          </p>

          <p>
          Taken together, these findings highlight both <strong>constraints and opportunities</strong> for managers. 
          Harvest and release practices are not uniform but shaped by <strong>social context, cultural legacies, and species-specific norms</strong>. 
          Recognizing this diversity can support more <strong>tailored regulations, communication, and stakeholder engagement</strong>, 
          ensuring that management strategies align with how anglers actually behave on the water. 
          </p>

            <h2>Methods</h2>

            <p>
              To understand what drives anglers’ decisions to harvest or release fish, we drew on 
              <strong>two year-long fishing diary programs</strong> in northern Germany. One was run in 
              Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania (MWP), where access is largely open, and the other in 
              Lower Saxony (LS), where angling is organized through clubs. Across both settings, anglers 
              documented their trips in real time: when and where they fished, what species they targeted, 
              how many fish they caught, how large they were, and whether they kept or released them.  
            </p>

            <p>
              The diaries were paired with survey data capturing <strong>angler characteristics</strong> 
              such as experience, skill, and orientation toward consumption. This allowed us to 
              link individual and cultural traits with actual harvest decisions. Trip context was 
              also included—for example, target species, time spent fishing, and satisfaction with 
              prior trips—since these situational factors often influence behavior.  
            </p>

            <p>
              We then applied <strong>statistical modeling frameworks</strong> to identify the strongest 
              predictors of harvest and release decisions. Models were designed to account for differences 
              across species, anglers, and fisheries, providing a robust picture of how psychological, 
              cultural, and contextual factors interact.  
            </p>

          <h2>Insights: Deep Dive</h2>
          <p>Figures progress from model-based predictions to behavioral patterns—illustrating not only <strong>what differs</strong>, but also <strong>how those differences can be explained and applied</strong>.</p>

        </span>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Using <strong>logistic mixed-effects models</strong>, we estimated the probability that anglers would 
            harvest their catch for each major species, while accounting for differences in catch rates 
            through a standardized <strong>CPUE (catch-per-unit effort)</strong> metric. This allowed 
            comparisons across species and between the two study regions.  
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Cultural baseline:</strong> Anglers in Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania (MWP, East Germany) 
              consistently harvested a greater share of their catch compared to Lower Saxony (LS, West Germany), 
              even after controlling for trip context and angler traits.  
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Catch scarcity effect:</strong> Across both regions, harvest probability rose when catch rates 
              were low—suggesting anglers are more likely to keep fish when they are harder to come by.  
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Species differences:</strong> Trout and cod show persistently high harvest probabilities, while 
              species like perch and zander display <em>selective release patterns</em>, with harvest likelihood 
              declining as CPUE increases.  
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Regional interactions:</strong> East–West contrasts are not uniform: MWP anglers harvested 
              <em>more carp</em> but <em>fewer perch, cod, and zander</em> relative to LS anglers, underscoring how 
              cultural history shapes species-specific norms.  
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These findings illustrate how <strong>species biology, catch conditions, and cultural context combine 
            to influence retention behavior</strong>. The approach goes beyond averages, generating predictive 
            insights that managers can use to anticipate harvest pressure under varying conditions.

          <h3>Harvest Behavior and Angler Attributes</h3>

        </span>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            By <strong>standardizing predictors (z-scoring)</strong>, the model isolates how six core angler attributes 
            shift the probability of harvest, holding other factors constant. Solid lines represent Lower Saxony (LS, 
            West Germany), dashed lines represent Mecklenburg–Western Pomerania (MWP, East Germany), with shaded 
            ribbons indicating 95% confidence intervals.  
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Age and lifestyle centrality:</strong> Older anglers and those who view fishing as central 
              to their lifestyle are consistently more likely to keep fish. The effect of centrality-to-lifestyle 
              (CTL) is particularly pronounced in LS, pointing to stronger cultural reinforcement of harvest in that region.  
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Skill and commitment:</strong> Higher self-perceived skill and stronger behavioral commitment 
              (e.g., time, effort, and investment in the activity) both reduce harvest rates. Experienced, highly 
              engaged anglers are more selective and more likely to release fish, especially species like pike and cyprinids.  
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consumption orientation:</strong> Anglers with stronger consumptive values predictably keep more 
              fish, underscoring how personal values translate directly into harvest behavior.  
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Non-effects:</strong> Catch orientation (general preference for catching vs. keeping) showed 
              no significant influence once other traits were accounted for—suggesting behavior is better explained 
              by specific values and skills than by broad stated preferences.  
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Species overlay:</strong> Regardless of angler traits, species identity still matters: trout, 
              salmonids, and cod remain the most frequently harvested, while pike sits at the opposite end as the 
              least consumptive species.  
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Taken together, the analysis shows how <strong>demographics, psychology, and culture intersect with species 
            biology</strong> to shape harvest outcomes. For managers, this means that outreach and regulation cannot be 
            “one size fits all”—strategies must align with the <em>values and experience profiles</em> of anglers as much 
            as with ecological conditions.

    <h3>Harvest Probability by Fish Size</h3>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Mixed-effects logistic regressions link <strong>individual fish size</strong> to harvest probability, shown 
      alongside observed size distributions for six focal species in Lower Saxony. Dashed vertical lines mark 
      <strong>legal minimum-size limits</strong>, providing a direct visual connection between regulation and angler behavior.  
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Size effect:</strong> Harvest probability rises steeply with fish length, peaking just above the 
        minimum-size thresholds. Beyond intermediate sizes, the effect tapers off—indicating that very large 
        “trophy” fish are increasingly likely to be released.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Species nuance:</strong> Trout and perch are harvested at high rates regardless of size, reflecting 
        cultural or culinary preferences. By contrast, carp display a different curve—harvest likelihood drops 
        for the largest individuals, signaling angler selectivity for release at trophy lengths.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Regulatory alignment:</strong> Inflection points in the curves coincide closely with statutory 
        size limits, underscoring that <em>angler choices and regulatory thresholds move in tandem</em>.  
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Robustness check:</strong> A sensitivity analysis (raising all limits by 20%) confirmed that 
        the size effect persists—reinforcing that harvest behavior is strongly size-driven, not an artifact of 
        current legal cutoffs.  
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Pairing <strong>predicted behavioral curves with observed length frequencies</strong> makes clear where 
      rules are effective and where angler practice introduces additional selectivity. This dual perspective 
      helps managers anticipate how changes to size regulations might shift harvest rates across species.

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<section>
  <h3>Communication & Outreach</h3>
  <ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.5;">
    <li><strong>Frame species differently:</strong> Position marine and trout harvest as culturally appropriate, while promoting stewardship narratives for pike and carp where voluntary release is already common.</li>
    <li><strong>Highlight trophy release norms:</strong> Share stories of anglers releasing large pike/carp to build social approval for protecting broodstock.</li>
    <li><strong>Segment messages by angler type:</strong> Skilled and highly avid anglers can be recruited as peer role models; centrality-driven anglers respond better to “protecting our waters” framing.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Policy & Regulation</h3>
  <ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.5;">
    <li><strong>Adopt size-based protections:</strong> Slot or trophy limits can reinforce existing behavior where anglers already release the biggest fish.</li>
    <li><strong>Tailor rules regionally:</strong> In MWP, emphasize daily limits and food-value guidance; in LS, clubs can trial selective-harvest policies with peer enforcement.</li>
    <li><strong>Link regulation to behavior:</strong> Align legal thresholds with natural inflection points in harvest probability to improve compliance and outcomes.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Monitoring & Adaptation</h3>
  <ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.5;">
    <li><strong>Standardize angler logs:</strong> Expand diary/logbook systems for trip-level harvest/release tracking across regions.</li>
    <li><strong>Pilot test changes:</strong> Trial new size or slot limits for 1–2 years with pre-set KPIs to evaluate effectiveness.</li>
    <li><strong>Track culture shifts:</strong> Use shorter pulse surveys to detect generational changes in release norms more quickly than long-interval studies.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, Caveats</h2>

<section>
  <h3>Clarifying Questions</h3>
  <ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.5;">
    <li><strong>Culture vs. time:</strong> How much of the East–West difference reflects lasting cultural traditions versus shifts over time in release behavior?</li>
    <li><strong>Voluntary vs. regulatory:</strong> To what extent were recorded releases driven by personal choice versus club or state rules?</li>
    <li><strong>Generational change:</strong> Are younger anglers systematically more release-oriented, or are differences mainly regional?</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Assumptions</h3>
  <ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.5;">
    <li><strong>Representativeness:</strong> Diary participants are assumed to reflect the wider angler populations in each state, despite different recruitment methods (phone vs. club-based).</li>
    <li><strong>Regulation baseline:</strong> Analyses assume anglers followed state minimum-size rules, even though some clubs may have stricter requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Stable predictors:</strong> Specialization, skill, and consumptive orientation are treated as consistent traits, not shifting within the year of study.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Caveats</h3>
  <ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.5;">
    <li><strong>Timing mismatch:</strong> The two surveys were conducted a decade apart, so regional contrasts may partly reflect temporal change rather than pure cultural difference.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-reporting:</strong> Data rely on anglers’ diaries, which may under- or overstate behaviors due to recall or social desirability bias.</li>
    <li><strong>Interpretation limits:</strong> Models capture associations, not causation; some drivers of voluntary release remain uncertain.</li>
  </ul>
