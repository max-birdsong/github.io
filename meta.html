				Background (technical)
			======================== -->
			<hr class="major" />
			<h2>Background</h2>

		
			<p>
			Our stakeholders, fisheries managers faced a fragmented evidence base: more than 20 peer-reviewed studies on angler satisfaction existed, 
			but they used different measures, reported results inconsistently, and often pointed in conflicting directions. 
			Without a synthesis, it was impossible to know which factors reliably shaped satisfaction or to base policy on 
			more than isolated findings. I conducted a <strong>multilevel meta-analysis</strong> to standardize results into 
			a common effect-size metric, account for multiple outcomes per study, and test variation across contexts with 
			subgroup analyses and meta-regressions. Reliability checks like funnel plots and sensitivity analyses further 
			strengthened confidence. The outcome was a <strong>coherent, decision-ready knowledge base</strong> that distilled 
			scattered research into clear priorities managers could trust when designing policies and programs.
			</p>



			<!-- ======================= -->
			<!-- Executive Summary -->
			<!-- ======================= -->
			<hr class="major" />
			<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

			<p>
			Across 23 studies on recreational angler satisfaction, results were highly fragmented: 
			different measures, inconsistent reporting, and sometimes contradictory conclusions. 
			By applying a <strong>multilevel meta-analysis</strong>, we synthesized this body of work into a 
			clear, evidence-based picture of what drives satisfaction across settings.
			</p>

			<p>
			The analysis revealed that <strong>catch-related components—catch success, harvest, and fish size—
			consistently show the strongest positive effects</strong> on satisfaction. 
			Two non-catch factors, <strong>space and congestion</strong>, also emerged as significant and influential, 
			while <strong>relaxation, facilities, aesthetics, and mastery</strong> showed moderate but reliable relationships. 
			By contrast, <strong>social quality and water quality perceptions</strong> were not consistently significant.
			</p>

			<p>
			Moderator analyses highlighted that <strong>species, country, and satisfaction metric</strong> shape how strongly 
			different components matter. For example, <strong>aesthetics, mastery, and relaxation are especially important 
			to freshwater anglers and in German studies</strong>, while catch-related factors remain universally strong 
			across all contexts. A publication bias check showed no significant evidence of distortion.
			</p>

			<p>
			Taken together, these results provide <strong>managers and policymakers with clear, defensible insights</strong>: 
			investments that improve catch outcomes and reduce congestion will yield the largest gains in satisfaction, 
			while the importance of non-catch aspects depends on context. The approach also demonstrates the power of 
			meta-analysis to turn fragmented evidence into <strong>decision-ready guidance</strong>—a transferable method for 
			other contested or complex management domains.
			</p>



			<!-- =======================
				Methods
			======================== -->
			<hr class="major" />
			<h2>Methods</h2>

			<p>
			We conducted a <strong>systematic review and meta-analysis</strong> of published studies on recreational angler satisfaction. 
			Our search used Web of Science, BioONE, BASE, Google Scholar, and archival sources (including the Ditton library), yielding 
			<strong>279 papers</strong>. After title, abstract, and full-text screening, <strong>23 studies (33 datasets, 172 effect sizes)</strong> 
			met inclusion criteria. Eligible studies reported satisfaction with both specific trip components (e.g., catch rate, crowding, 
			facilities) and overall angling satisfaction on a common scale, or linked actual trip outcomes to reported quality.
			</p>

                <img src="images/meta3.JPG" alt="Study screening flow" />
              </span>
			  </div>

			<p>
			Effect sizes were transformed into a standardized <strong>Fisher’s z</strong>, ensuring comparability across study designs and 
			metrics. To account for non-independence of multiple results per study, we fitted a <strong>three-level random-effects model</strong> 
			using restricted maximum likelihood with Knapp–Hartung adjustment, nesting effect sizes within studies. Subgroup analyses 
			classified satisfaction determinants into categories such as <em>catch, harvest, size, congestion, facilities, aesthetics, relaxation, mastery, 
			social quality, space,</em> and <em>water quality</em>. We also tested <strong>moderator effects</strong> of country, species, satisfaction metric, 
			and fishery type (wild vs. put-and-take) through univariate meta-regressions.
			</p>

			<p>
			To assess robustness, we conducted <strong>sensitivity checks</strong> (e.g., reversing direction of negative indicators such as crowding) and 
			examined <strong>publication bias</strong> with funnel plots and Begg–Mazumdar rank correlation tests. Analyses were implemented in R using 
			the <code>metafor</code> package, ensuring reproducibility and transparency.

		<!-- ======================= -->
	
		<h2>Insights: Deep Dive</h2>

		<p>
		The meta-analysis unpacked hundreds of effect sizes into a clear picture of what consistently drives angler satisfaction, 
		where results vary, and how reliable the evidence base is. Below are the key layers of insight.
		</p>

		<!-- Subgroup Effects -->
		<h3>Which Experience Components Drive Satisfaction?</h3>

		<p>
		To understand which components of an angling experience mattered most, we compared 
		<strong>11 experience components</strong> against overall satisfaction across studies. 
		The chart below shows the pooled effect size for each factor, with confidence intervals.
		</p>

		<div style="max-width:700px; margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;">
		<span class="image fit">
			<img src="images/meta2.JPG" alt="Effect sizes of 11 experience components on satisfaction" />
		</span>
		<p class="viz-caption">
			<em>Effect sizes reflect pooled correlations across studies. Strong effects (g&gt;0.4) are shown in dark blue, 
			moderate effects (g&gt;0.2) in light blue, and insignificant effects in grey.</em>
		</p>
		</div>

		<style>
		.viz-caption {
			text-align: center;
			font-size: 0.9rem;
			color: #444;
			margin-top: 0.6rem;
		}
		</style>

		<ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.5;">
		<li><strong>Catch-related factors dominated:</strong> Catch, harvest, and fish size consistently showed 
			the strongest positive effects on overall satisfaction.</li>
		<li><strong>Space and congestion mattered too:</strong> Anglers valued room on the water and disliked crowding; 
			both emerged as strong non-catch determinants.</li>
		<li><strong>Moderate but meaningful effects:</strong> Relaxation, aesthetics, facilities, and mastery all showed 
			moderate yet significant relationships with satisfaction.</li>
		<li><strong>No consistent effect:</strong> Social quality and perceived water quality were not significantly related 
			to satisfaction across studies.</li>
		</ul>

		<!-- Meta-Regression -->
		<h3>Meta-Regression: Interpreting Results by Context</h3>

		<p>
		One advantage of meta-analysis is the ability to <strong>separate results by key subgroups</strong>—for example, 
		target species, country, or whether satisfaction was measured by trip or year. 
		These comparisons reveal how much context shifts the importance of different experience dimensions. 
		For instance, <strong>catch-related factors remained strong across all groups</strong>, while 
		aesthetics, relaxation, and mastery showed larger effects in German and freshwater studies. 
		Measuring satisfaction over a full year also made non-catch dimensions more influential 
		compared to single-trip measures.
		</p>

		<div style="max-width:700px; margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;">
		<span class="image fit">
			<img src="images/meta4.JPG" alt="Meta-regression of moderators of angler satisfaction" />
		</span>
		<p class="viz-caption">
			<em>Note:</em> Insignificant effects are shown in grey. Differences between groups are considered 
    significant when 95% confidence bars do not overlap.
		</p>
		</div>

		<p>
		For managers, the key takeaway is that <strong>evidence can be filtered by the contexts most 
		relevant to their fishery</strong>. This makes it possible to identify which levers are most 
		likely to improve satisfaction in their setting—whether that means emphasizing catch, investing 
		in facilities, or addressing congestion.
		</p>



		<!-- Bias -->
		<h3>Publication Bias Check</h3>

		<p>
		Because meta-analyses combine results across many independent studies, it’s important to test whether 
		the available evidence is <strong>systematically biased</strong>—for example, if studies with 
		non-significant or “negative” results were less likely to be published. 
		To assess this, we generated a <strong>funnel plot</strong> (Figure 5).
		</p>

		<div style="max-width:300px; margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;">
		<span class="image fit">
			<img src="images/meta5.JPG" alt="Funnel plot bias check" />
		</span>
	
		</div>
	<p>
			<em>The funnel plot showed no significant asymmetry (p = .356; Kendall's τ = 0.487), 
			indicating limited evidence of publication bias in the dataset.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
		This result provides confidence that the synthesized findings are not driven solely by selective 
		reporting. For decision-makers, the implication is that <strong>the identified satisfaction drivers 
		are robust across the published evidence base</strong>, rather than reflecting a skewed subset of studies.

			<h2>Recommendations</h2>

			<section>
			<h3>Evidence-Based Priority Setting</h3>
			<ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.5;">
				<li><strong>Elevate catch-related factors:</strong> Consistently strong effects of catch, size, and harvest mean these remain the most reliable levers for improving angler satisfaction across contexts.</li>
				<li><strong>Don’t overlook non-catch drivers:</strong> Space and congestion also had major effects—showing that crowding can offset biological success and should be a management priority.</li>
				<li><strong>Support the “whole experience” view:</strong> Facilities, aesthetics, and relaxation carried moderate but significant influence, reminding managers that quality infrastructure and environment matter as much as fish.</li>
			</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
			<h3>Context-Specific Management</h3>
			<ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.5;">
				<li><strong>Tailor by species:</strong> Freshwater anglers placed higher importance on mastery and relaxation, while catch-related aspects were equally important across species—highlighting where context shapes priorities.</li>
				<li><strong>Adapt by geography:</strong> German studies emphasized aesthetics and social experiences more than North American ones, suggesting cultural differences in what drives satisfaction.</li>
				<li><strong>Measure satisfaction carefully:</strong> Annual satisfaction scores captured stronger effects for many drivers than trip-level scores—showing that survey design choices shape insights.</li>
			</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
			<h3>Program & Policy Applications</h3>
			<ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.5;">
				<li><strong>Balance biological and social strategies:</strong> Stocking and harvest management remain key, but capacity limits, site design, and aesthetics should be built into planning.</li>
				<li><strong>Invest in crowding solutions:</strong> Rotating access, spatial zoning, or timing policies can directly address congestion—a high-impact satisfaction driver.</li>
				<li><strong>Frame communication broadly:</strong> Outreach should highlight not just fish availability but also the quality of space, environment, and community around angling.</li>
			</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
			<h3>Data & Future Research</h3>
			<ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.5;">
				<li><strong>Standardize measurement:</strong> Future studies should adopt common satisfaction metrics to reduce heterogeneity and strengthen comparability.</li>
				<li><strong>Expand beyond catch:</strong> More consistent reporting of non-catch dimensions (e.g., social quality, water quality) would fill key evidence gaps.</li>
				<li><strong>Continue synthesis:</strong> Updating this meta-analysis with new data ensures that management keeps pace with evolving angler values.</li>
			</ul>
			</section>


			<hr class="major" />
			<h2>Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, and Caveats</h2>

			<section>
			<h3>Clarifying Questions</h3>
			<ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.5;">
				<li><strong>Geographic scope:</strong> Would results hold in regions not represented (e.g., Asia, South America, Africa)?</li>
				<li><strong>Alternative study designs:</strong> How might including economics-focused studies (e.g., choice models) change conclusions?</li>
				<li><strong>Interaction of factors:</strong> Do satisfaction components operate additively, or are there thresholds/synergies across dimensions?</li>
			</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
			<h3>Assumptions</h3>
			<ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.5;">
				<li><strong>Inclusion criteria:</strong> Only studies that measured both component-level and overall satisfaction were included, ensuring comparability.</li>
				<li><strong>Framework choice:</strong> Adopted the “sum-of-satisfactions” approach, assuming each component contributes independently.</li>
				<li><strong>Comparability across studies:</strong> Standardized all findings to a common effect-size metric to allow pooling.</li>
			</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
			<h3>Caveats</h3>
			<ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.5;">
				<li><strong>Geographic bias:</strong> Most studies were from the U.S., Germany, and Canada—limiting generalizability elsewhere.</li>
				<li><strong>Context dependence:</strong> Moderator results show that drivers of satisfaction vary by species, country, and metric; findings are not one-size-fits-all.</li>
				<li><strong>Scope limitations:</strong> Excluding certain traditions (e.g., purely economic valuation) narrows the lens but strengthens comparability.</li>
