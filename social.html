             Background (technical)
              ======================== -->
      <hr class="major" />
      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
        Grizzly bear conservation in Montana is shaped not only by biological realities, 
        but also by <strong>deep social divisions</strong>. Hunters and nonhunters often hold 
        sharply different views about grizzlies, and these differences go beyond demographics 
        or direct encounters. They are rooted in <strong>social identity</strong>—how people 
        see themselves and their in-groups in relation to wildlife and policy.
      </p>

      <p>
        To investigate these dynamics, we used a statewide survey of 
        <strong>1,758 Montana residents</strong> to examine how experiences with grizzlies 
        (from distant sightings to reports of property damage) are filtered through 
        identity-based lenses. Applying <strong>structural equation modeling (SEM)</strong>, 
        we tested whether hunter identity changes how people interpret experiences, form 
        attitudes, and ultimately decide whether the grizzly population is “too large” 
        or “too small.” The results provide <strong>defensible insight</strong> into why 
        support and opposition to carnivore management remain polarized—and how Montana’s 
        social landscape will shape the success of conservation plans moving forward.
      </p>


 <!-- ======================= -->
<!-- Executive Summary -->
<!-- ======================= -->
<hr class="major" />
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>
  Montanans’ experiences with grizzly bears are widespread, but <strong>hunters report significantly more frequent and more negative encounters</strong> than non-hunters. 
  Hunters were 34% more likely to see grizzlies from afar, 64% more likely to report a fearful encounter, and 75% more likely to experience direct property damage. 
  They also heard more secondhand stories of conflict, reflecting social networks where hunting is common.
</p>

<p>
  Structural equation modeling revealed that <strong>social identity shapes how these experiences translate into attitudes and acceptance</strong>. 
  Neutral sightings tended to reduce fear and improve attitudes among non-hunters, but had little effect on hunters. 
  In contrast, <strong>vicarious property damage strongly eroded hunters’ attitudes</strong>, while having no significant effect on non-hunters. 
  The model explained roughly half of the variation in population beliefs (<em>R²</em> = 0.51), showing that identity-driven processes are central to the policy landscape.
</p>

<p>
  Taken together, the findings highlight a dynamic of both risk and opportunity: 
  <strong>hunters’ in-group storytelling amplifies conflict and can drive attitudes downward, while non-hunters remain more insulated and more responsive to neutral experiences</strong>. 
  These insights suggest that <strong>conflict prevention, positive encounter framing, and careful communication within and across identity groups</strong> will be essential for managing grizzly recovery in Montana without deepening polarization.
</p>

             Methods
======================== -->
<hr class="major" />
<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
  We conducted a <strong>statewide mail survey</strong> of Montana residents in 2019–2020, drawing a
  random sample of 5,350 households. Three mailings (2–4 weeks apart) followed best-practice survey
  design standards, and 1,758 residents returned usable responses. The survey was pretested with
  graduate students, faculty, and agency staff to ensure clarity.
</p>

<p>
  The questionnaire measured several elements known to shape people’s views of wildlife:
</p>
<ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.6;">
  <li><strong>Attitudes</strong> toward grizzly bears, using a series of rating questions.</li>
  <li><strong>Emotional responses</strong> such as fear or anxiety.</li>
  <li><strong>Experiences</strong> with grizzlies, including neutral encounters (e.g., seeing one at a
      distance) and hearing about property damage secondhand.</li>
  <li><strong>Beliefs about population size</strong>, asking whether the current grizzly population
      is too small, about right, or too large.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  To make sure results represented Montana’s adult population, survey data were
  <strong>weighted</strong> for selection probability, nonresponse, and census benchmarks, producing
  a margin of error of roughly ±3.5%. We also compared <strong>hunters (n=901)</strong> and
  <strong>nonhunters (n=774)</strong> to see if their experiences and responses differed.
</p>

<p>
  For analysis, we used <strong>structural equation modeling (SEM)</strong>. SEM is a statistical
  technique that goes beyond simple correlations or regressions. Instead of looking at one
  relationship at a time, it maps out a <strong>chain of cause-and-effect links</strong> between
  multiple factors. In this case, the models tested:
</p>

<ul style="margin:.6rem 0 1rem 1.2rem; line-height:1.6;">
  <li>How <strong>experiences</strong> with grizzlies influence <strong>emotions</strong>.</li>
  <li>How those emotions then shape <strong>attitudes</strong>.</li>
  <li>And how attitudes ultimately feed into <strong>population size beliefs</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  SEM also allowed us to test whether these pathways looked different for
  <strong>hunters versus nonhunters</strong>—for example, whether a distant sighting improves
  tolerance among nonhunters but has no effect among hunters. By tracing these links, SEM reveals
  the <strong>underlying mechanisms</strong> that connect day-to-day experiences with broader
  policy views, rather than just reporting surface-level differences.

  </span>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Before attitudes and policies come into play, the most basic difference is simply 
      <strong>how often people encounter grizzly bears</strong>. Hunters consistently report 
      more contact with grizzlies across every experience type—ranging from distant sightings 
      to direct property damage.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hunters were <strong>34% more likely</strong> to see grizzlies from afar.</li>
      <li>They were <strong>64% more likely</strong> to report a fearful encounter.</li>
      <li><strong>75% more likely</strong> to have experienced property damage firsthand.</li>
      <li><strong>43% more likely</strong> to hear of damage through friends or family.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This pattern reflects both hunters’ time spent outdoors and their <strong>social networks 
      that circulate grizzly stories and incidents</strong>. Taken together, hunters enter the 
      policy conversation with a <strong>denser web of personal and vicarious experiences</strong> 
      than non-hunters—an essential foundation for the identity-driven differences we model later.

  </span>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The <strong>structural equation model (SEM)</strong> unpacks the chain of influence: 
      how experiences with grizzly bears and the <strong>hunter vs. non-hunter identity</strong> 
      combine to shape emotions, attitudes, and ultimately <strong>beliefs about how many 
      grizzlies Montana should have</strong>. Arrow thickness reflects effect strength, and 
      together the model explains over half of the variation in policy views (<em>R²</em> = 0.51).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Neutral experiences matter:</strong> Seeing bears from afar generally 
        builds more positive feelings (β = 0.395), but this effect is <em>much stronger for non-hunters</em>. 
        For hunters, distant sightings don’t carry the same positive weight.</li>
      <li><strong>Identity shapes fear:</strong> Simply being a hunter was linked with 
        less fear of grizzlies overall (β = 0.405), independent of actual experiences.</li>
      <li><strong>Damage stories divide groups:</strong> Hearing about property damage 
        was a <em>major negative driver</em> for hunters (β = −0.381), pulling their attitudes 
        downward, while non-hunters’ views were largely unaffected by these stories.</li>
      <li><strong>Attitudes are pivotal:</strong> Among all pathways, attitudes toward grizzlies 
        had the largest direct effect on beliefs about population size (β = −0.571), far outweighing 
        direct effects of identity or experience alone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In short, the SEM shows that <strong>hunters’ denser and often negative experiences translate 
      into stricter views on grizzly numbers, mediated through group identity and shared stories</strong>. 
      Non-hunters, by contrast, lean more on positive encounters and are less swayed by damage reports. 
      These identity-driven pathways explain <em>why</em> hunters and non-hunters arrive at such different 
      conclusions about management—even when living in the same landscapes.

  </span>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      These faceted <strong>density plots</strong> show the full distribution of attitudes toward grizzlies 
      (1 = strongly negative, 5 = strongly positive) across four groups: hunters and non-hunters, 
      each split by whether they reported <strong>vicarious property damage (VPD)</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Baseline contrast:</strong> Even without damage, hunters’ attitudes cluster lower 
          than non-hunters, signaling a built-in identity gap.</li>
      <li><strong>Damage effect:</strong> For hunters, exposure to VPD pulls the entire curve 
          leftward—toward more negative attitudes—making the difference stark. 
          Among non-hunters, the curve barely shifts.</li>
      <li><strong>Distributional lens:</strong> This highlights that the impact isn’t just a small 
          average dip—<em>the whole population of hunters moves</em> toward the negative end when 
          damage stories circulate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This visualization reinforces the SEM findings: <strong>identity filters the impact of experiences</strong>. 
      For hunters, property damage stories cascade into collective attitude shifts. 
      For non-hunters, the same information barely registers. 
      Understanding these distributional patterns helps explain why conflicts over grizzly management 
      remain so polarized across groups sharing the same landscape.

<p>
Our findings suggest that <strong>social identity is a key driver of how Montanans interpret 
experiences with grizzly bears</strong>. Hunters are more exposed to negative encounters and 
more influenced by stories within their in-group, which amplifies risks of polarization 
between hunters and non-hunters as bear populations expand. Based on these insights, 
we recommend the following actions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Prioritize conflict prevention:</strong> Because vicarious property damage among 
    hunters drives negative attitudes, managers should reduce the occurrence and spread 
    of such incidents by securing attractants (garbage, livestock feed) and deploying 
    proactive mitigation measures in high-risk areas.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Amplify positive experiences:</strong> Neutral or positive encounters improve 
    attitudes—especially among non-hunters. Public education campaigns, guided viewing 
    opportunities, and rapid-response communications that highlight coexistence success 
    stories can help normalize grizzly presence.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Use trusted in-group voices:</strong> Hunters are most influenced by fellow hunters. 
    Partnering with respected hunting organizations or local leaders to share balanced 
    messages about bear management may be more effective than agency-led messaging alone.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Frame around shared identity:</strong> Emphasizing common ground (e.g., being 
    “Montanans” who care about outdoor traditions and safety) may soften divisions 
    between hunters and non-hunters and reduce the perception of polarization.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Monitor polarization risk:</strong> Continued survey work can help detect 
    widening gaps between groups. Early recognition of diverging attitudes allows 
    managers to intervene before polarization hardens into intractable conflict.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Taken together, these steps highlight a shift from treating hunters and non-hunters as 
monolithic “stakeholder groups” toward recognizing the <strong>identity-driven dynamics 
within and between them</strong>. Management strategies that build on in-group trust, 
reduce conflict exposure, and highlight shared values will be better positioned to 
sustain both <strong>grizzly bear conservation and social acceptance</strong> in Montana.

<h2>Clarifying Questions, Assumptions, Caveats</h2>

<p>
While this study provides new insight into how <strong>social identity shapes attitudes toward 
grizzly bears</strong>, several caveats should be kept in mind when interpreting the results:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Cross-sectional data:</strong> The survey represents a snapshot in time (2019–2020). 
    Attitudes and identity dynamics may evolve as grizzly populations expand or as policy 
    debates intensify. Longitudinal work would be needed to capture change over time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Identity strength not measured:</strong> We classified respondents as hunters 
    or non-hunters, but did not assess how strongly individuals identified with these 
    groups. Identity salience could moderate effects but was beyond the scope here.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Focus on Montana:</strong> Results reflect the cultural and ecological context of 
    Montana, where grizzly populations are recovering and hunting is central to rural 
    identity. Findings may differ in other regions or with other species.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mechanisms inferred, not proven:</strong> The observed interactions (e.g., 
    hunters’ stronger response to vicarious property damage) are consistent with 
    in-group dynamics, but causal processes were not directly measured.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Survey design limits:</strong> As with all self-reported surveys, responses 
    may be influenced by recall error, social desirability, or nonresponse bias, 
    though weighting procedures helped minimize these risks.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
These caveats do not undermine the core finding—that <strong>identity-driven dynamics 
powerfully shape wildlife attitudes</strong>—but they highlight the need for 
follow-up research and context-sensitive application of these results in management.
